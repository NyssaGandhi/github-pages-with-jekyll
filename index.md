Hello everyone! This blog is a fun way to share some stuff with everyone. I'm an artist and animator, and I have some strengths in gaming and martial arts. I am a first degree black belt, and have some years of experience in Tae-Kwon-Do. I enjoy spending time with my friends and other people so if you want to check out my social media it's at the bottome of the page in the About Me section. Hop you enjoy your time here!
